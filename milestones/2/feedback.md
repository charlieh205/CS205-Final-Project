# High-level description feedback

Great project idea.

I understand your plan is essentially similar to what Lesierson et al. 2020 did
in the first reading, i.e., optimizing a matrix-matrix product? I assume this
will focus on shared memory parallelization(?).  Note that we currently do not
have access to GPUs and I am currently clarifying this (should you need GPUs
later).

I am looking forward to your next results.
